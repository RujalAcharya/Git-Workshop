Just a beginner, trying out things!


A short story:
A boy, recently shifted to a new location.
He, being very shy, couldn't make new friends in his new place and new school.
He missed all of his friends, which made him sadder.
Watching his new classmates play in the field, while he stared in the sky made one of his classmates curious.
The new mate, called him and introduced him to the class. They played with him, talked and laughed together.
Now, he had new friends to talk too and enjoy. 

So, let us all be friends and enjoy together. Cheers.

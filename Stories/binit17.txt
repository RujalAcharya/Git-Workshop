naruto is a great series.

naruto's and hinata's love story is greatest of all. 

one piece is a great series of all . i lreally love it too

it is all about a dream of the boy to be the king of the pirates.

with his crew he sails to the grand canyon to search for the greatest treasure of all time called one piece.

The Wise Man

People have been coming to the wise man, complaining about the same problems every time. One day he told them a joke and everyone roared in laughter.

After a couple of minutes, he told them the same joke and only a few of them smiled. When he told the same joke for the third time no one laughed anymore.


The great Question:

“You can’t laugh at the same joke over and over. So why are you always crying about the same problem?”

Moral of the Story:
Worrying won’t solve your problems, it’ll just waste your time and energy.

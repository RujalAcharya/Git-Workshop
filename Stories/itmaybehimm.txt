The Golden Egg

There was a farmer who lived in a remote village in the mountains. One day he found a chicken and took it home. The next morning he was suprsied as it gave golden eggs.
The farmer was filled with joy and told his wife with a lot of exictement. He sold the eggs and earned a lot of moneyn daily. One day the wife has a idea to kill the
chicken and get all of the eggs stored in its belly. The farmer sadly had to agree and sliced the chicken's belly and to their suprise there was no eggs. 
The farmer lost the chicken.

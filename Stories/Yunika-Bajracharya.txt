The Metamorphosis

That morning when Gregor woke up, he felt refreshed and energized. When he opened his eyes, the warm yellow sun rays were already peeking through the little open slit of the curtain. Gregor had had a good sleep after a long time. Pleased, he stretched his arms and tried to turn around, but he could not. He moved his blanket aside and a loud shrill cry came out of his mouth. What he saw was impossible to believe â€” he laid on his bed with a horrible black bloated body that looked like one a spider would have.

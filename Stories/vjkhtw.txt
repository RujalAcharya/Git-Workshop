A Voice
I was walking around a ghost town, exploring the ruined houses with excitement like Bear Grylls. As I was going through an old church, I heard a voice. Someone was calling me. "Who could it be?" a question popped in my mind because I was in a place where rarely anyone visited. The probability of those very few knowing my name was 1 out of billionth. I was in a place hidden from most of the people. So, who was the person calling my name? My excitements now turned into fear. I panicked. I could hear a noise, the noise of a footstep approaching towards me.
I cried, shouted for help. I felt like I was dying.
Suddenly a man came. The sunlight had blocked his face, but his dresses were like that of the military." Sir, civilians aren't allowed here.", he cried. He had a gun pointed towards me. He took me away. A bald guy downstairs asked me my name. I replied, "Sire Hamada aka Sir.".
My roommate wakes me up. Out of a sudden, I am in my bed. My friend curiously looks at me and asks if I am fine.

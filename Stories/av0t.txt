The animals from a farm in scotland were feeling upset. 

They thinking about how miserable their lives were. 

This is a story of farm animals starting a rebellion agianst thier owners. 
It was a peaceful morning but the animals weren't at peace.
A group of pigs had called a meeting at the red barn.

Julia was just going to her classes when she saw a figure approaching her.
It was Jake, the guy everyone actively avoided because of his entitled nature.
She didn't like him, at all.
He approached her and asked for her number.
Julia didn't want to give him her number. So, she denied.
But he still insisted on her giving him her number.
Even though she denied over and over, he was persistent.
So, Julia said, "Fine." and gave him a number.
He looked proud, and went on his merry way, smirking.
Later, he sent a text that read: "hey julia you wanna be my girlfriend? you are lucky that i chose you"
After a while, he got a reply: "creep"
He was shocked. How could the girl he had chosen say such a thing to him!
He asked: "why the hell would you call me that!"
"well if you weren't a creep then julia would've given you her actual number"

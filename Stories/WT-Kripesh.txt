"That's where he belongs."
"Home"
"Where he's always belonged"
"Things are gonna be different now."

"You aren't going to say goodbye?"
"Its never Goodbye"

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when i see you again
we've come a long way from where we began 
Oh,I'ii tell you all about it when i see you again

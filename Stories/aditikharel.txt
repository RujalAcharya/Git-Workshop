Harry Potter and The book that shouldn't have been written

The Cursed Child should never have been written. I hate the idea of Voldemort having a daughter. 
The whole plot is a disaster. Draco was better off as as a villain with regrets. 
When we could get a book about history of magic and Hogwarts, we got this trash where the whole plot could have been
avoided if kids weren't dumb enough to use time turner.

# Git Workshop Assignment Guidelines
The pull request should contain the following additions:

1. A new file named **username.txt** inside the Stories directory. For e.g, john-doe.txt. 
2. The newly created file should contain a short story of your choice along with your **name** and your **email**. 
3. A commit resolving a merge conflict. 

For #3, you will need to create a merge conflict on the newly created file. Please make sure you don’t change any other files. One way of preventing it would be to use `git status` before you add files to the staging area. Make sure that the only file modified is the new file you created. Also, **the commit message for the commit that resolves the conflict**, must explicitly begin with “Merge conflict resolved”. 

Please follow the guidelines below when submitting your assignment:
* The pull request should only modify your own file. 
* The pull request should not conflict with the main repository. 
* Your pull request can have as many commits as you want.
* The pull request must be sent to the main branch of the repository. 
* The pull request must contain only 1 additional file. 
* The pull request and commit message must be sensible.

The pull requests which don't follow the aforementioned guidelines will not be accepted.

**Also, remember the following**

* Do **NOT** work in the `main` branch of your local repository. Always create a new branch when making changes.
* Always do a `git pull` or `git fetch` **before** you push your changes to your remote.
